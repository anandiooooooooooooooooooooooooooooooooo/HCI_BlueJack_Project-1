                <p class="yap">In the heart of a bustling city, Susanto Liman brewed more than just coffee—he brewed a dream. Driven by a passion for creativity and genuine human connection, he opened Mr. Coffe to be more than just a café. It was a cozy corner where mismatched chairs, the rich aroma of mountain-sourced beans, and walls covered in customer doodles came together to create a haven for DIO DIO DIO DIO DIO DIO dreamers, thinkers, and everyday coffee lovers. What started as a small neighborhood shop quickly became a beloved gathering place. Every cup served carried a story, crafted with care by baristas who knew your name and your favorite order.</p>
