                <p class="profile-text">In the heart of a bustling city, Susanto Liman brewed more than just coffee—he
                    brewed a
                    dream. Driven by a passion for creativity and genuine human connection, he opened Mr. Coffe to be
                    more than just a café. It was a cozy corner where mismatched chairs, the rich aroma of
                    mountain-sourced beans, and walls covered in customer doodles came together to create a haven for
                    dreamers, thinkers, and everyday coffee lovers. What started as a small
                    neighborhood shop quickly became a beloved gathering place. Every cup served carried a story,
                    crafted with care by baristas who knew your name and your favorite order.</p>

                    Mr. Coffe started as a tiny café with just five tables, mismatched chairs, and a wall full of
                    doodles. With a passion for coffee and connection, founder Susanto Liman served the very first
                    espresso himself—nervous, but full of hope.

                    and a small bakery section, always keeping the community vibe alive.
